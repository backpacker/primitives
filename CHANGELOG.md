# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

‚ö†Ô∏è The changelog should be **human-readable**, so everything that's added here should be easy to understand without additional lookups and checks (usually, this means that adding the JIRA ticket title is not enough; please explain what happened).

A good entry follows the following format:

- `MODULE` What was added/changed/removed/fixed.

Headers are one of:

- `Added`, `Changed`, `Removed` or `Fixed`.

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

## [1.0.0]

üöÄ Initial release. Contains `Layout`, `Typography`, `Spacer`, `Touchable` `Expandable` and `Modal` primitives.
