# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

⚠️ The changelog should be **human-readable**, so everything that's added here should be easy to understand without additional lookups and checks (usually, this means that adding the JIRA ticket title is not enough; please explain what happened).

A good entry follows the following format:
- `MODULE` What was added/changed/removed/fixed.

Headers are one of:
- `Added`, `Changed`, `Removed` or `Fixed`.
